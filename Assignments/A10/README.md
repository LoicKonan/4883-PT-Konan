## Assignment 10 -  Sunny Mountains &  Brick Wall Patterns

### Loic Konan

#### Description

> **Note that, in this picture, the sunny mountainsides are emphasized by bold lines and the coordinates**<br>
> **of the landscape are emphasized by bold points.**<br>
>
> The goal of this problem is to calculate the total length in meters of the bold lines.
> For this task consider that:
>
> - (1) for all coordinates (x, y), 0 ≤ x ≤ 30000 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 8848;
> - (2) the unit is the meter; 
> - (3) all the X-coordinates are pair-wise distinct; 
> - (4) the leftmost point has 0 as
> X-coordinate and the rightmost point has 0 as Y-coordinate; 
> - (5) The total number of coordinates given is n ≤ 100.

## Brick Wall Patterns

#### Description

> If we want to build a brick wall out of the usual size<br>
> of brick which has a length twice as long as its height,<br>
> and if our wall is to be two units tall, we can make our<br>
> wall in a number of patterns, depending on how long<br>
> we want it. From the figure one observe that:<br>
>
> - There is just one wall pattern which is 1 unit wide made by putting the brick on its end.
> - There are 2 patterns for a wall of length 2:<br>
> two side-ways bricks laid on top of each other and<br>
> two bricks long-ways up put next to each other.
> - There are three patterns for walls of length 3.
>
> How many patterns can you find for a wall of **length 4?** And, for a wall of **length 5?**<br>
>
> Your task is to write a program that given the length of a wall,<br>
> **determines how many patterns there may be for a wall of that length.**
