### Loic Konan

#### Description

> **Note that, in this picture, the sunny mountainsides are emphasized by bold lines and the coordinates**<br>
> **of the landscape are emphasized by bold points.**<br>
>
> The goal of this problem is to calculate the total length in meters of the bold lines.
> For this task consider that:
>
> - (1) for all coordinates (x, y), 0 ≤ x ≤ 30000 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 8848; 
> - (2) the unit is the meter; 
> - (3) all the X-coordinates are pair-wise distinct; 
> - (4) the leftmost point has 0 as
> X-coordinate and the rightmost point has 0 as Y-coordinate; 
> - (5) The total number of coordinates given is n ≤ 100.
