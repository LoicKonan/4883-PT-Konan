### Loic Konan

#### Description

> The maze cells are numbered 1, 2, . . . , N, where N is the total number of cells.
> You can assume that N â‰¤ 100.
>
> - The first three input lines contain N, the number of cells in the maze, E,
> the number of the exit cell, and the starting value T for the count-down timer **(in some arbitrary time unit)**.
> - The fourth line contains the number M of connections in the maze, and is followed by M lines, each
> specifying a connection with three integer numbers: **two cell numbers a and b (in the range 1, . . . , N)**
> and the number of time units it takes to travel from a to b.
>
> - The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.
> - The output consists of a single line with the number of mice that reached the exit cell E in at most
> T time units.
