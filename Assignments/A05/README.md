## Assignment 5 - Traffic Lights

### Loic Konan

#### Description

<pre>One way of achieving a smooth and economical drive to work is to ‘catch’ every traffic light, that is
have every signal change to green as you approach it. One day you notice as you come over the brow of
a hill that every traffic light you can see has just changed to green and that therefore your chances of
catching every signal is slight. As you wait at a red light you begin to wonder how long it will be before
all the lights again show green, not necessarily all turn green, merely all show green simultaneously,
even if it is only for a second.<br>
</pre>

- Write a **program that will determine whether this event occurs within a reasonable time**.
- Time is measured from the instant when they all turned green simultaneously, although the initial portion
while they are all still green is excluded from the reckoning.
