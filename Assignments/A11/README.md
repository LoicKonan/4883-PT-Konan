## Assignment 11 - Hay Points

### Loic Konan

#### Description

> Each employee of a bureaucracy has a job description — a few paragraphs that describe the<br>
> responsibilities of the job. The employee’s job description, combined with other factors,<br>
> such as seniority, is used to determine his or her salary.<br>
> The Hay Point system frees the Human Resources department from having to make an intelligent judgement<br>
> as to the value of the employee; the job description is merely scanned for<br>
> words and phrases that indicate responsibility.<br>
> In particular, job descriptions that indicate control over a large budget or management<br>
> over a large number of people yield high Hay Point scores.<br>
>
> - You are to implement a simplified Hay Point system.
> - You will be given a Hay Point dictionary and a number of job descriptions.
> - For each job description you are to compute the salary associated with the job, according to the system.
