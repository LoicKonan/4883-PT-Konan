## Assignment 11 - Brick Wall Patterns

### Loic Konan

#### Description

> If we want to build a brick wall out of the usual size<br>
> of brick which has a length twice as long as its height,<br>
> and if our wall is to be two units tall, we can make our<br>
> wall in a number of patterns, depending on how long<br>
> we want it. From the figure one observe that:<br>
>
> - There is just one wall pattern which is 1 unit wide made by putting the brick on its end.
> - There are 2 patterns for a wall of length 2:<br>
> two side-ways bricks laid on top of each other and<br>
> two bricks long-ways up put next to each other.
> - There are three patterns for walls of length 3.
>
> How many patterns can you find for a wall of length 4? And, for a wall of length 5?<br>
>
> Your task is to write a program that given the length of a wall, determines how many patterns there<br>
> may be for a wall of that length.
