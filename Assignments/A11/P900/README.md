## Assignment 11 - Brick Wall Patterns

### Loic Konan

#### Description

> - **Dynamic Programming** to find Fibonacci numbers up to 50.
> In an array that can hold 51 elements.
> Using the base cases of fib(1) = 1, fib(2) = 2, ignoring the fib(0) since it won't be needed.
> compute the remaining Fibonacci numbers in the range [3..50].
> Stop if n = 0.
