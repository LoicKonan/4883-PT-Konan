## Relational Operators

#### Description
>
> Given two numerical values your job is just to find out the relationship between them
> that is (i) First one is greater than the second (ii) First one is less than the second
> or (iii) First and second one is equal.
>
>
> - First line of the input file is an integer t (t < 15) which denotes how many sets of inputs are there.
> - Each of the next t lines contain two integers a and b (|a|, |b| < 1000000001).

## Language Detection

#### Description

> - Input file contains around 2000 lines of inputs.
> - Each line contains a string S. You can assume that all the letters of the string are uppercase English
> letters and the **maximum length of the string is 14**.
> - Input is terminated by a line containing a single **‘#’** character (without the quote).
> - This line should not be processed.

## Egypt

#### Description
>
> - Input represents several test cases, followed by a line containing ‘0 0 0’.
> - Each test case has three positive integers, less than 30,000, denoting the
> lengths of the sides of a triangle.
> - For each test case, a line containing **‘right’** if the triangle is a right triangle,
> and a line containing **‘wrong’** if the triangle is not a right triangle
>
