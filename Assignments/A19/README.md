#### Description
>
> A particle has initial velocity and acceleration. 
> If its velocity after certain time is v then what will its displacement be in twice of that time?
>
> The input will contain two integers in each line. Each line makes one set of input.
> These two integers denote the value of v (−100 ≤ v ≤ 100) and t (0 ≤ t ≤ 200) (t means at the time the particle gains that velocity)
>
> For each line of input print a single integer in one line denoting the displacement in double of that time.
