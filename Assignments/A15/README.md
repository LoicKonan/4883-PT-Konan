## Assignment 15 - Binary Search Tree

### Loic Konan

#### Description

> A **binary search tree** is a ***binary tree*** that satisfies the following properties:
>
> - The **_left subtree_** of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than the node's key**.
> - The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than the node's key**.
> - Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
>
> - **Pre-order traversal (Root-Left-Right)** prints out the nodes key by visiting the root node then traversing <br>
> - the left subtree and then traversing the right subtree.
>
> **Post-order traversal (Left Right-Root)** prints out the left subtree first and then right subtree and finally the root node.
>
> For example, the results of **pre-order traversal** and **post-order traversal:**
>
> - **Pre-order:** **50 30 24 5 28 45 98 52 60** <br>
> - **Post-order:** **5 28 24 45 30 60 52 98 50** <br>
>
> - **Given the pre-order traversal of a binary search tree, you task is to find the post-order traversal of this tree.**
>
> **Input**
>
> - The keys of all nodes of the input binary search tree are given according to pre-order traversal.
> - Each node has a key value which is a positive integer less than 106.
> - All values are given in separate lines(one integer per line).
> - You can assume that a binary search tree does not contain more than **10,000 nodes** and there are no duplicate nodes.
>
> **Output**
>
> - The output contains **the result of post-order traversal** of the **input binary tree**. Print out one key per line.
