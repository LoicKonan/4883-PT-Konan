## Assignment 7 - Place The Guards

### Loic Konan

#### Description

> In the country of Ajabdesh there are some streets and junctions.
> Each street **connects 2 junctions**. The king of Ajabdesh wants to
> place some guards in some junctions so that all the junctions and
> streets can be guarded by them. **A guard in a junction can guard**
> **all the junctions and streets adjacent to it**. But the guards themselves
> are not gentle. If a street is guarded by multiple guards
> then **they start fighting**. So the king does not want the scenario
> where a street may be guarded by two guards. Given the information
> about the streets and junctions of Ajabdesh, help the king
> to **find the minimum number of guards needed to guard all the**
> **junctions and streets of his country.**
