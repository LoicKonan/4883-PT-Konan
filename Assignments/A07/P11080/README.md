## Assignment 7 - Place The Guards

### Loic Konan

#### Description

"Help the king to find the **Minimum** Number of guards needed to guard all the junctions and streets of his country."

- on approach for bicoloring **(determine the graph is bipartite or not )** use **BFS** method.
- If Its not BiGraph print -1;

- **Example that had three calls. We ignore the -1's:**

  > - Call 1 => [ 1  0  1 -1 -1] (smallest set is 0 or 1 guard )
  > - Call 2 => [-1 -1 -1  1 -1] (smallest set is 1  or 1 guard)
  > - Call 3 => [-1 -1 -1 -1  1] (smallest set is 1  or 1 guard)
  > - **1 + 1 + 1 = 3 (correct answer)**

- **Example is 5 vertices 0 edges:**
  
  > - Call 1 => [ 1 -1 -1 -1 -1] (each call has a 1 for the vertex that needs a guard)
  > - Call 2 => [-1  1 -1 -1 -1]
  > - Call 3 => [-1 -1  1 -1 -1]
  > - Call 4 => [-1 -1 -1  1 -1]
  > - Call 5 => [-1 -1 -1 -1  1]
â€‹  > - **1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5**
