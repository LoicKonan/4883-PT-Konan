## Assignment 6 - Jolly Jumpers

### Loic Konan

#### Description

A sequence of **n > 0** integers is called a ***jolly jumper*** if the absolute values of the difference between
successive elements take on all the values **1 through n - 1**. For instance,<br>
**1 4 2 3**
is a **jolly jumper, because the absolutes differences are 3, 2, and 1 respectively**.<br>
The definition implies that any sequence of a ***single integer is a jolly jumper***.<br> 

- You are to write a program to determine whether or not each of a number of sequences is a jolly jumper.
