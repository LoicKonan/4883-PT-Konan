## Assignment 09 - The Never Ending Towers of Hanoi

### Loic Konan

#### Description

> - In 1883, Edward Lucas invented, or perhaps reinvented, one of the most popular puzzles of all times
> - **{ the Tower of Hanoi, as he called it }** which is still used today in many computer science textbooks
> - to demonstrate how to write a recursive algorithm or program. First of all, we will make a list of the
> - rules of the puzzle:
>
    > - There are three pegs: A, B and C.
    > - There are n disks. The number n is constant while working the puzzle.
    > - All disks are different in size.
    > - The disks are initially stacked on peg A so that they increase in size from the top to the bottom.
    > - The goal of the puzzle is to transfer the entire tower from the A peg to the peg C.
    > - One disk at a time can be moved from the top of a stack either to an empty peg or to a peg with
> - a larger disk than itself on the top of its stack.
> - Your job will be to write a program which will show a copy of the puzzle on the screen step by step,
> - as you move the disks around. This program has to solve the problem in an efficient way.
> - **TIP:** It is well known and rather easy to prove that the minimum number of moves needed to complete
> - the puzzle with n disks is 2n - 1.
