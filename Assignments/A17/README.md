## Assignment 17 - Tree Summing

### Loic Konan

#### Description

> Given a binary tree of integers, you are to write a program
> that determines whether there exists a root-to-leaf path whose
> nodes sum to a specified integer.
> For example, in the tree shown on the right there are exactly four root-to-leaf paths.
>
> - The sums of the paths are 27, 22, 26, and 18.
> - Binary trees are represented in the input file as LISP S-expressions having the following form.
>
> There should be one line of output for each test case **(integer/tree pair)** in the input file.
>
> - For each pair I, T (I represents the integer, T represents the tree).
> - The output is the string **‘yes’** if there is a root-to-leaf path in T whose sum is I and
> **‘no’** if there is no path in T whose sum is I.
